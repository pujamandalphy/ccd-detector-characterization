# CCD Detector Characterization and Data Analysis

This repository documents a comprehensive CCD detector characterization study carried out using Python-based data analysis.

The work is divided into four structured analysis modules, each focusing on a specific physical or statistical aspect of CCD performance.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Artificial Signal Analysis
📄 part1_artificial_signal_analysis.pdf  
- Injection and analysis of artificial signals  
- Verification of statistical behaviour  

### Part 2: Dark Current and Median Statistics
📄 part2_dark_current_median_analysis.pdf  
- Dark frame analysis  
- Hot pixel detection and median-based noise estimation  

### Part 3: Linearity and Gain Response
📄 part3_linearity_response_analysis.pdf  
- Exposure time vs signal response  
- Linearity testing and error modelling  

### Part 4: CCD Characterization Summary
📄 part4_ccd_characterization_summary.pdf  
- Combined interpretation of detector properties  
- Final conclusions  

## Tools and Methods
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Astropy  
Statistical modelling and error analysis

## Notes
The analysis was originally performed in a Jupyter environment and later exported to PDF for documentation.
